			Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
			through some interesting plasces on the way:
		</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Walla Walla, WA</li>
		<li>Magic City, ID</li>
		<li>Bountiful, UT</li>
		<li>Last Chance, CO</li>
		</ul>

			I saw some <strong>Burma Shave</strong> style <code>signs on the side</code> of the road today:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			Passing cars,<br>
			When you can't see,<br>
			May get you,<br>
			A glimpse,<br>
			Of eternity."<br>

		</blockquote>
		<p>I won't be passing any cars.</p>

		<p>
			<time>Wed Jun 21</time>My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got
			everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway,
			I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cell phone, iPod,
			digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentials. As
			Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins
			with one Segway.</q>
